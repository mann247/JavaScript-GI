# Create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

    Requirements:
        The game should have a user interface with an input box that allows the user to enter rock, paper or scissors.
    When the input is submitted, the game must: 
        validate the userâ€™s input 
        generate a random computer choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and display it.
        Compare the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner.
        Display the result of the game (e.g., "You win!", "Computer wins!", or "It's a tie!") on the web page.
    Optional Challenge:
        Add a score counter to keep track of the number of wins, losses, and ties.
        Implement a reset button that clears the score and allows the user to start a new game.
    *Reminder your codebase should include/ consist of:
        Pseudocode
        Neat with consistent formatting
        Good naming conventions 
        Comments around functionality.
