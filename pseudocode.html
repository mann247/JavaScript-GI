Create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

What to use?
    - HTML (Should be a very simple code)
    - CSS (This file should have the second most code)
    - JavaScript (This file should have the most code)

Game should have the following: 
    1. User Interface
        a. User can enter rock, paper, or scissors
        What will this look like?
        - reset button on the bottom of the page
        - user can choose which hand to select
        - once it's selected, then the cpu will "choose" a different image. >> update: generates text instead.
        - buttons do not have to be images, can be text (7-19-2025)

        - prompt user to choose rock, paper, or scissors
            - can be done with a label
            - done with button images

    2. Needs Validation
         - when the user clicks rock/paper/scissor button image... then...
         it needs to be store in a variable in javascript

    3. Create an "NPC" >> (figure out how to create a CPU player)
        - needs to be a function for the NPC
        - needs to generate either a rock/paper/scissors image >> update: generates text instead.
        - needs to be stored in a variable in javascript

    4. Winner Comparison
        a. If... Else??

            - If user chooses rock 
                if npc chooses rock ... tie
                else if npc chooses paper... player loses
                else if npc chooses scissors... player wins

                **nested if statement syntax**
                if (choice = rock){
                    if (npc-choice = paper){
                        result('You lose!')
                }
        b. what about a switch statement? (7-19-25)

    5. Game Results Message.
        a. console log?
        b. an alert? 
        c. display on the screen?

To get a 4...
    1. Score Counter
        a. Three separate ones: Wins, Losses, Ties
            - variable to track the user, cpu, and tied scores

    2. A Reset Button
        a. clears the score
        b. clears the text
        c. allows the user to restart the game

    3. Can this page be responsive?

    ***project needs 4 variables, update depending on what the user clicks** >> update: project ended up having more than 4 variables.
